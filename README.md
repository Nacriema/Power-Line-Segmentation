# About the project

This project is the part of the PMIS system, I did it about a year ago. Recently, I've found that there are many updates in this field, so I think this is the good time to kick-off this repository again.

My target is to read these recently papers and re implement the models as the author suggesed.

## Project structure

### 1. TTPLA Dataset

I use TTPLA Dataset to training difference Segmentation model. So, I made code for creating TTPLA training image from original meta data. 

For more infomation, see the code inside [TTPLA_Processing](./TTPLA_Processing/)

### 2. Model Zoo 

All code and the related model, I'll update inside [Model_Zoo](./Model_Zoo/) folder

### 3. Results

Result for each model will be updated in this part

* [UNet++](./docs/md/unet_plus_plus_experiment.md)


### 4. Improvements

All ideas to improve the performance of the segmentation will be update [here](./docs/md/ways_to_improve.md)
